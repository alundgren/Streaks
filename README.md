# Streaks

Just playing with finding the longest sequence in strings like 1001101110. In the example the run 111 is the longest so 3 would be the answer.

The c# project holds both the unit tests and the c# solutions while the f# project has just the f# solution.

To test the code run

> dotnet test

From the c# project.
